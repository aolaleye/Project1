### Objective - 

Our app uses the Yummly api to search their recipe database. Search options will be by dish, desired ingredients, and/or ingredients to exclude.  the last feature can be used to exclude spcific ingredients for dietary or allergy purposes.  Ex: Searching for a brownie recipe, but the user is allergic to nuts.

The app will store the user's selected ingredients.  We also intend to allow users to favorite recipes.

When searching by ingredients, we would like to add the functionality of pulling the ingredient list from the JSON, comparing the to user's selected ingredients on hand, and compiling a shopping list for the user with the remaining ingredients.

Google maps API will be used to provide the user with nearby grocery stores where they can purchase the indgredients for their dish.

### UI -
    
Image is uploaded of the sketched UI.

Materialize will be the CSS framework.

### Database -

Firebase is used to store user data.
