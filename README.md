#### Overview:
    * Our app uses the Yummly api to search their recipe database. 
    * Search options are by dish, desired ingredients, and/or ingredients to exclude.  
    * Advanced search options include cuisine, diet, and cooking time.
    * After results are returned, there is an option to favorite recipes.  
    * When the user favorites a recipe, a 'show favorites' button will appear.
    * The Google Maps API is used to provide the user with nearby grocery stores where they can purchase the indgredients for their dish.
