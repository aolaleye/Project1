#### Overview:
* Our app uses the Yummly api to search their recipe database. 
* Search options are by dish, desired ingredients, and/or ingredients to exclude.  
* Advanced search options include cuisine, diet, and cooking time.
* After results are returned, there is an option to favorite recipes.  
* When the user favorites a recipe, a 'show favorites' button will appear.
* The Google Maps API is used to provide the user with nearby grocery stores where they can purchase the indgredients for their dish.

#### Database:
* Firebase is used to store user searches and favorites.

#### Our app utilizes: 
* Two apis
* Ajax to pull data
* Materialize as the CSS framework and for mobile responsiveness
* Github Pages for deployment
* User input validation
